# CSC447-Parallel-Programming

Last Updated: Spring 2017

This repository contains the work required from CSC447 students during the lab. 
Solutions will be added on a weekly basis as well as some references and go-to websites.

# About the Course

This undergraduate course provides an introduction to prallel programming with a focus on multicore architectures and cluster programming techniques. 
Topics include relevant architectural trends and aspects of multicores, writing multicore programs and extracting data parallelism using vectors and SIMD, thread-level parallelism, task-based parallelism, efficient sybchronization, program profiling, and performance tuning. Message-passing cluster-based parallel computing is also introduced. 
The course includes several programming assignments to provide students first-hand experience with programming, and experimentally analyzing and tuning parallel software.

#  Course Learning Outcomes
1)	Students shall demonstrate an ability to design, analyze, and implement shared-memory programming applications on multicore systems.
2)	Students shall demonstrate an ability to design, analyze, and implement message-passing programming applications on a cluster of workstations.
3)	Students shall demonstrate an ability to analyze the efficiency of a given parallel algorithm.
4)	Students should understand the challenges of as well as the motivations for using parallel programming.
